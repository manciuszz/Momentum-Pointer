# Momentum-Pointer

This is basically the same as Synaptics Touchpad's "Cursor Momentum" feature, but for all touchpads.

> Depending on the forcefulness and direction of the finger flick the cursor glides on the screen an equivalent distance.
After a flick of the finger, your movements inertia is "transferred" to the pointer which continues its trajectory with the same speed and direction of your finger, effectively gliding through your desktop. The gliding pointers' physics include friction and hence it will slow down over time eventually stopping. After some tries it is easy to estimate intuitively where the pointer will stop, vastly improving touchpad ergonomics by drastically reducing the total distance of finger/hand travel required. It also works very well with multiple monitor setups.
